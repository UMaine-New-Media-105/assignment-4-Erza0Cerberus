Assignment 4;1: For this assingment we had to make a loop inside a function that could be reused with a changeable function. When using loops I am often reminding of the toy windmills and therefore I decided to make some.

Assignment 4;2: For this assignment, we had to take the sprite made in the previous assignment and turn it into a 2D pattern that had multiple sprites!

Assignment 4;3: For this assignment we had to duplicate assignment 4.2 and make it have random attributes so that everytime we refresh the code, it is different. I decided to make it so the color and size changed at random!
